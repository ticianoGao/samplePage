        Hi! My name is Melvin Ticiano Gao. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science + Mechanical Engineering student. 
        I've volunnteered for helping migrant school students to learn English and host fun activities for 
        them weekly. For the past few years, I've been using gt-scheduler for class registrations and really 
        benefited from it. These things make me believe in that providing helps to others are essential to 
        bettering this society.
